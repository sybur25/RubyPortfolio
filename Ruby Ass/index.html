                <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm Ruby, I am an Artiste/Songwriter, Filmmaker/Actress, and Digital Creator. I'm a student of Pan-Atlantic University.
                   I developed an interest in the Film and Music Industry at a tender age.My songwriting style is truly one-of-a-kind with its poetic flair, and incorporating the Nigerian language in it makes it even more relatable to my desired audience.
                   My passion for digital creation started through photography and videography basically.</p>
